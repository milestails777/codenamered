                    <p>Hello, my name is Miles. You can also call me Miles Tails Delta-777 as full name or just Miles Cibis as my real name. I am a junior software developer, which loves programming on JavaScript and doing some funny stuff too.</p>

                    <p>Hi hello greetings I'm other developer of this humble site, known as Red or Prism. However it's easy for you to refer to me as.</p>
                    <p>I'm one of the few people who take interest in indie games, software development and art. Either of those things are done horribly when it comes to actually doing something with them.</p>
                    <p>Like the other developer whom I consider a friend and a non-biological brother figure, I am also an Estonian. You aren't getting any other information from me.</p>
